# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 2. Version Differences
```
1. Actual UI
   For the original, if you want to search news by the categories, for the full page view (left sketch) as you can see, you must scroll down all the way to get the categories list. I think that is not a good idea. And if you visit the news page (right sketch), you will immediately see the news headline without noticing whether is it true or no that even the headline included in the category of the news you choosed. Because you after you clicked on the category, you want to see the news with the category right? (Not the main page for the news)
   
a. Alternative Solution (1)
   For the first alternative, i want to make the viewer being able to see what they want, so i make sketched the category bars in the side area of the page so that they can see all the categories available. The news line becoming like a list-type-of posting too.
   
b. Alternative Solution (2)
   For th second alternative, this is more likely to be the interactive version from the first alternative. Adding more motion to attract more clicking and simplified the bars.
   
c. Alterative Solution (3)
   For the last alternative, the dropdown is leveled up a bit, using animation and the categories are using icon instead of just words. The dropdown should be not covering the background completely, but becoming half invisible so that the news can still be seen
```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
The last one because it feels more modern.
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
I think it is important for the user to know exactly what will they do, so placing all the user's choice in 1 view as possible important too.
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
    Operating System : Windows
    RAM : 4 GB
    Display : 1306 x 768 (32 bit)
    Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U CPU @2.20 GHz 
    Input : Keyboard, Mouse, and Touchscreen
   
```
### 2. Users
```
Those who are good with computers, good at english, familiar with certain types of web designs. Users are expected to be arround my age (19) and can use input devices (mouse and keyboard) well. 
```

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
